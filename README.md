How to use CalyxOS to create a privacy-focussed &amp; de-Googled Smartphone


Your smartphone is spying on you. Just google it, like https://t3n.de/news/spion-jackentasche-android-1417804/?filtered=1

Especially see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4rstFcPcjE

So it might be a good idea to leave Apple behind ([already did that with my laptop](https://github.com/jonashackt/mac-to-linux)) - and also Google, because there are spying heavily using their Play Services. And now the AI trains comes into play also... 


## Choose a distro based on AOSP (Android Open Source Project)

There are multiple OpenSource powered alternative OSses you can choose from. For example https://lineageos.org, https://e.foundation, https://grapheneos.org and https://calyxos.org. Most of the alternative OSses are based on the AOSP (Android Open Source Project).


### CalyxOS vs. GrapheneOS

For me the most promising projects are CalyxOS and GrapheneOS, where there are slight differences:

https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/comments/13yft74/why_would_anyone_choose_calyxos_over_grapheneos/:
* main difference is: One seeks to share no information (GrapheneOS); the other is fine with sharing only fake information with google (CalyxOS). Choosing one of the other will be dependent on your threat model and that is a personal choice. 

https://threecats.com.au/why-use-grapheneos-rather-than-calyxos-degoogled-custom-alternative-android-os:

* GrapheneOS seems to be the most frequently updated system




https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4rstFcPcjE advises to use CalyxOS, since the company he runs has the least customer issues with this OS.

#### Compatibility with "special apps"

##### Banking Apps

Banking apps seem to often work, but often also not: https://grapheneos.org/usage#banking-apps 

Here's an overview including GitHub issues for every bank: https://privsec.dev/posts/android/banking-applications-compatibility-with-grapheneos/

## CalyxOS and GrapheneOS mainly support Google Pixel phones

CalyxOS some other devices, but both CalyxOS and GrapheneOS support every Google Pixel phone.

So as I want to have the latest hardware (camera!!), I choose the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which has an even better camera than a iPhone 16+:

It also features as great result in the radiation tests done by the connect magazine: https://www.connect.de/vergleich/strahlungsarme-handys-bestenliste-1500639.html
